# Tema 3 - Photography Portfolio

Made a photography portfolio for a made up person, I tried to focus on "old school" photography which uses film and has to be developed in a dark room. That is mainly where I took my inspiration for the gallery, I wanted it to feel like the images has been hanged up and developed on a string.

Its made with vanilla HTML, CSS and JS, designed and made a prototype in FIGMA before I started development.

The criterias were:

- Should be responsive and fit on mobile and desktop.
- Should use a gridsystem for layout and BEM system for the CSS code structur.
- Should contain interactive elements.

Was able to replicate my design pretty well, ofc there were minor variations in it. Think I mostly hit the criterias, if you are interested in seeing the prototypes in figma here they are:
